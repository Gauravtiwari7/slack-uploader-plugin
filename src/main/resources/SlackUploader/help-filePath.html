    Enter the directory path of the files you want to upload to Slack. The path maybe followed by a regex to specify the files you want to upload.eg - /var/lib/*.jpg
    <br> If no regex is specified, all the files from the directory will be uploaded.</br>
    <br> Do not use a regex if you want to set a custom fileName.</br>
